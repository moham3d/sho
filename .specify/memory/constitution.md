# Al-Shorouk Radiology Management System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Healthcare-First Design
All features MUST prioritize patient safety, clinical workflow efficiency, and healthcare compliance. Every development decision MUST be evaluated against its impact on patient care quality and safety. Clinical workflows MUST take precedence over technical convenience. Healthcare compliance requirements are non-negotiable and MUST be built into the system architecture from the ground up.

### II. Role-Based Security
Strict separation of nurse, doctor, and admin functions with appropriate data access controls. Security MUST be implemented at the database level through Row Level Security (RLS) policies. User authentication MUST use JWT tokens with role-based claims. All data access MUST be auditable and traceable to specific user actions.

### III. Data Integrity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Complete audit trails, digital signatures, and form lifecycle management are mandatory. All patient interactions MUST be logged with timestamps and user identification. Digital signatures MUST be cryptographically secure and legally binding. Form states (draft/signed/completed) MUST be immutable once signed. Database constraints MUST enforce referential integrity.

### IV. Arabic Language Support
Full RTL (Right-to-Left) support and bilingual interface for Arabic/English healthcare environment. All medical terminology MUST support Arabic translations. User interface MUST adapt to RTL text direction. Date formats, number formatting, and cultural conventions MUST accommodate Arabic locale requirements.

### V. HIPAA-Style Privacy
Patient data protection through RLS policies and secure authentication. All patient data MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit. Access controls MUST implement least-privilege principles. Data retention and deletion policies MUST comply with healthcare privacy regulations. Audit logs MUST track all patient data access and modifications.

## Development Guidelines

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with comprehensive type safety
- **Backend**: PostgREST for automatic REST API generation from PostgreSQL schema
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with mandatory Row Level Security (RLS) implementation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **Containerization**: Docker-first approach for all services
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for system monitoring and notifications

### Form Management Standards
- Comprehensive nursing assessments and radiology evaluations with digital signatures
- All forms MUST support draft/signed lifecycle with immutable signed state
- Digital signature capture MUST be integrated into form workflows
- Form validation MUST occur at both client and server levels
- Auto-save functionality MUST prevent data loss during form completion

## Quality Standards

### Testing and Validation
- All forms MUST support draft/signed lifecycle testing
- Database schema MUST enforce referential integrity through automated tests
- Authentication MUST use JWT with role-based claims validation
- All patient interactions MUST be auditable through automated logging
- System MUST handle Arabic medical terminology without data corruption

### Error Handling and Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring for healthcare reliability
- Real-time error tracking and alerting systems
- Health monitoring dashboards for system administrators
- Automated backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Performance monitoring to ensure clinical workflow efficiency

### Security and Compliance
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with healthcare data protection standards
- Secure coding practices and vulnerability assessments
- Regular updates and security patch management
- Data encryption for all sensitive healthcare information

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All code changes MUST comply with these principles before deployment. Amendments to this constitution require documented justification, stakeholder approval, and migration plans for existing systems.

All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Technical complexity MUST be justified against healthcare requirements and patient safety considerations. When healthcare requirements conflict with technical preferences, healthcare MUST take precedence.
