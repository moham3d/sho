- Q: What fall risk assessment tool should be implemented? → A: Morse Fall Scale (6 factors, 0-125 score range)
- Q: What should be the target concurrent user capacity for the system? → A: 20 concurrent users
- Q: What should be the maximum acceptable response time for user actions? → A: 1 second for all interactions
- Q: How should digital signatures be technically implemented? → A: Canvas-based signature pad with base64 encoding
- Q: How should Arabic language integration be handled in the user interface? → A: Bilingual interface allowing user to switch between Arabic/English

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A nurse receives a patient for radiology services, conducts a comprehensive nursing assessment including vital signs and risk evaluations, then transfers the case to a radiologist who completes technical evaluations and imaging parameters. Throughout this process, administrators monitor system performance and ensure compliance with healthcare standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new patient arrives, **When** a nurse searches by national ID, **Then** the system either displays existing patient record or allows creation of new record
2. **Given** a patient record exists, **When** a nurse starts a new visit, **Then** the system creates a visit record and allows nursing assessment form completion
3. **Given** a nursing assessment is complete, **When** the nurse captures digital signature, **Then** the form becomes immutable and available to assigned doctor
4. **Given** a nurse assessment exists, **When** a doctor reviews the case, **Then** the system displays all nursing data and allows doctor form completion
5. **Given** doctor evaluation is complete, **When** both patient and doctor signatures are captured, **Then** the case is marked as complete
6. **Given** system is in operation, **When** an administrator accesses monitoring dashboard, **Then** real-time health metrics and error logs are displayed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a patient has no national ID or documentation?
- How does system handle duplicate patient records with similar names?
- What occurs when a form is partially completed and nurse session expires?
- How does system manage cases where doctor needs to return forms to nurse for additional information?
- What happens when digital signature capture fails or is incomplete?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
